/* 
gcc -fPIC -shared -o libsum.so sum.c 

-fPIC: PIC stands for Position Independent Code 
       this is required for dynamic linking/shared libraries. 
       Means that the library can be executed regardless of its memory address
-shared: produces a shared object that can be linked with others
-o: defines the output file to write to

The steps for calling C functions in python using ctypes!
    - Write your C function(s) (keep in mind how you want to call this in python)
    - Create a shared library (.so file) for your function(s)
    - Using ctypes, create a python wrapper for your C code
    - In python, call the function you want from the wrapper
